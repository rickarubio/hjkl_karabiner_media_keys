# HJKL Karabiner Media Keys

I use a happy hacking keyboard and vim a lot.

Since there is no dedicated media key on my keyboard, I started using Karabiner.

I finally got around to looking through Karabiner docs and created HJKL key bindings for the media keys, enjoy!

## How To Install

1. Install [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
2. Edit your private.xml File, typically located at /Users/your_user_name/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml
3. Copy the private.xml file in this repo or just the parts you need
4. Open up Karabiner and go to the Change Key tab. Reload XML & Select VIM Style Media Keys!
4. If you found this repo helpful, star it!
5. Feel free to open issues for suggestions if you'd like me to add more or want to contribute, thanks!
